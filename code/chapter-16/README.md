# Code for Chapter 16: Simulating a Self-Driving Car using End-to-End Deep Learning with Keras

Using the photorealistic simulation environment of Microsoft AirSim, guest authors **Aditya Sharma** and **Mitchell Spryn** guide us in training a virtual car by driving it first within the environment and then teaching an AI model to replicate its behavior. Along the way, this chapter covers a number of concepts that are applicable in the autonomous car industry.
