# Code for Chapter 13: Shazam for Food: Developing Android Apps with TensorFlow Lite and ML Kit

We bring AI to Android with the help of TensorFlow Lite. We then look at cross-platform development using ML Kit (which is built on top of TensorFlow Lite) and Fritz to explore the end-to-end development life cycle for building a self-improving AI app. Along the way we look at model versioning, A/B testing, measuring success, dynamic updates, model optimization, and other topics. Bonus: We get to hear about **Pete Wardenâ€™s** (technical lead for Mobile and Embedded TensorFlow) rich experience in bringing AI to edge devices.
